# LDR Photoresistor Module

#### Project Overview

The LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) Photoresistor Module project demonstrates how to use an LDR with an Arduino Mega to measure ambient light intensity. The LDR's resistance changes based on the amount of light falling on it, which is then converted into a voltage by the Arduino's analog-to-digital converter (ADC). This project reads the analog voltage from the LDR and prints the light intensity values to the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **LDR (Photoresistor)**
- **Resistor (optional for voltage divider)**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the LDR to Arduino Mega:**
   - **LDR Pin**: Connect to analog pin A0 on Arduino Mega
   - **VCC**: Connect to 5V on Arduino (or use a voltage divider if needed)
   - **GND**: Connect to GND on Arduino

   *Note: Depending on the LDR's resistance range, you may need to use a resistor in series (voltage divider configuration) to ensure the voltage is within the ADC's range.*

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the LDR module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE (set to 9600 baud).
   - Observe the Serial Monitor for the light intensity values printed as sensor readings.

#### Applications

- **Automatic Lighting Control:** Adjust lighting based on ambient light levels.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Measure light intensity in indoor or outdoor environments.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Implement energy-saving strategies based on natural light availability.

#### Notes

- Ensure the LDR is exposed to the light source you intend to measure.
- Calibrate readings as needed based on environmental conditions and sensor placement.
- Experiment with different resistors in the voltage divider to optimize sensitivity and range.
